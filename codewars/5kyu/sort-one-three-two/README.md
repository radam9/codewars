## Description

# Hey You !

Sort these integers for me ...

By name ...

Do it now !


---

## Input

* Range is ```0```-```999```

* There may be duplicates

* The array may be empty

## Example

* Input: 1, 2, 3, 4
* Equivalent names: "one", "two", "three", "four"
* Sorted by name: "four", "one", "three", "two"
* Output: 4, 1, 3, 2

## Notes
* Don't pack words together:
 * e.g. 99 may be "ninety nine" or "ninety-nine"; but not "ninetynine"
 * e.g 101 may be "one hundred one" or "one hundred and one"; but not "onehundredone"
* Don't fret about formatting rules, because if rules are consistently applied it has no effect anyway:
 * e.g. "one hundred one", "one hundred two"; is same order as "one hundred **and** one", "one hundred **and** two"
 * e.g. "ninety eight", "ninety nine"; is same order as "ninety-eight", "ninety-nine"
 
```if:c
* For `C` code the input array may be NULL. The return value is freed if non-NULL.
