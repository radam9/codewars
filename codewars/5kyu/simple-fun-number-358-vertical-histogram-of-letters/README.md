## Description

# Task

You are given a string `s`. Your task is to count the number of each letter (A-Z), and make a vertical histogram as result. Look at the following examples to understand the rules.

# Example

For `s = "XXY YY ZZZ123ZZZ AAA BB C"`, the output should be:
```
          *
          *
          *
*       * *
* *   * * *
* * * * * *
A B C X Y Z
```
# Rules

- You just need to count the uppercase letters. Any other character will be ignored.
- Using `*` to represent the number of characters. 
- The order of output is form A to Z. Characters that do not appear in the string are ignored.
- To beautify the histogram, there is a space between every pair of columns.
- There are no extra spaces at the end of each row. Also, use "\n" to separate rows.
- Happy Coding `^_^`
