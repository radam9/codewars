## Description

In this kata we want to convert a string into an integer. The strings simply represent the numbers in words.

Examples:

* "one" => 1
* "twenty" => 20
* "two hundred forty-six" => 246
* "seven hundred eighty-three thousand nine hundred and nineteen" => 783919

Additional Notes:

* The minimum number is "zero" (inclusively)
* The maximum number, which must be supported is 1 million (inclusively)
* The "and" in e.g. "one hundred and twenty-four" is optional, in some cases it's present and in others it's not
* All tested numbers are valid, you don't need to validate them
